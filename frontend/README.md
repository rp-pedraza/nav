# frontend

This project was generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0.

## To activate server:

    grunt serve

## To build files in `./dist`:

    grunt build

## Different backend server address

If the backend server is listening to a different address other than `http://localhost:5000`, you should change the value of `backend_server` in `app/scripts/config.js`.  You should also do that before running `grunt build` to make the new configuration affect the output files.
